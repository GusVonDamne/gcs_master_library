# Notes
This is a [free-form data](./free-form%20data.md "free-form data") field. The contents appear under the title of the parent element and as part of the [Character Sheet](./Character%20Sheet.md "Character Sheet"). The Master Library has many uses of this field to add commentary about traits and skills.

This isn't a [Markdown](./Markdown.md "Markdown") field. But it does allow hard return and tab. Ha! Psyche. No one likes tab.

The Notes field is used as an option in [Prerequisites](./Prerequisites.md "Prerequisites").
